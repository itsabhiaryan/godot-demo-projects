# Godot demo projects

Each folder containing an `engine.cfg` file is a demo project meant to
be used with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), the open source
2D and 3D game engine.

Those demos are distributed under the terms of the MIT license, as
described in the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file.

**Note:**
Master branch is compatible with the latest Godot version (currently 3.0). Use the appropriate branch for your Godot version, for example branch [2.1](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/2.1) for Godot 2.1.x.
